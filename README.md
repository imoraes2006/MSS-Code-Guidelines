## Contributors
**YOU!** - please contribute to these code guidelines! If you have any
suggestions for improvement to these guidelines, *[create an issue][issue]* to
discuss it or *create a [pull request][pr]* with your changes and discussion
will occur on that PR.  Also review the [contributing guidelines](https://github.com/TurnerBroadcasting/mss-code-guidelines/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md).

## Conflict Resolution
We have included [JSHint][jshint] and [JSCS][jscs] RC files in this repository
to validate javascript code against these guidelines.  When something is
questioned, these files will always win.  When in doubt, run JSHint and JSCS
with the `.jshintrc` and `.jscsrc` files in place and see if they find any
problems.  It is recommended that you find plugins for your editor of choice to
always validate your code against these files.

### Regarding the multiple suffixed files
There are several `.jscs` and `.jshintrc` files with suffixes in this repo.  It
is up to you to choose the most appropriate one for your project.  Hopefully the
suffixes are clear, but just in case, here are some more details.

- **.jscs**: A JavaScript Code Style config file for ECMAScript 5 code.

- **.jscs-es6**: A JavaScript Code Style config file for ECMAScript 6 code.

- **.jshintrc-browser**: A JS Hint config file for browser based ECMAScript 5
  code.

- **.jshintrc-node**: A JS Hint config file for NodeJS 0.10.x ECMAScript 5 code.

- **.jshintrc-node-es6**: A JS Hint config file for NodeJS 0.11.x+ and IO.js
  ECMAScript 6 code.


## LOGGING LEVELS

This is intended to be a short developer note on guidance for logging levels.
Exception handlers should log exceptions.


### Background

A brief synopsis of why we log and the implications for logging levels.

- Hunt down bugs

- Enable automated monitoring for errors and warnings and/or trigger Hipchat
  alerts

- Maintain an audit trail

- Record application status

- Debugging configuration issues


#### IMPORTANT

- Used sparingly

- Used on production

- Example: System start/restart


#### FATAL

- Used for recording a failure that prevents system from starting or shuts down
  an application

- Used on production

- Triggers a DOC alert

- Example: Systems becomes unusable


#### ERROR

- Records when failure occurs but system is stll usable

- Used on production

- Triggers a DOC alert

- Example: PAL errors talking to IBIS


#### WARNING

- A scenario that indicates something is wrong with the system but does not
  prevent system from operating correctly

- Used on production

- Monitored and triggers DOC if defined levels exceeded

- Example: Invalid login attempts


#### INFO

- General system statusâ€” Does not indicate something is wrong

- Used on production

- Should be able to be enabled in production

- Example: Reestablish connection to external service


#### DEBUG

- Enables developer context (stack trace and/or other context of issue) for
  debugging a problem

- Should not be used in production for performance as well as security reasons.

- Example: Null pointer exception


#### VERBOSE

- Should be used for capturing detailed implementation and diagnostic level
  detail that you might want to enable in rare situations (a more verbose INFO)

- Not used in production

- Touch base with your Tech Lead for this level of logging


#### SILLY

- Should be used for capturing very detailed implementation and diagnostic level
  detail that you might want to enable in very rare situations (a more verbose
  DEBUG)

- Not used in production

- Touch base with your Tech Lead for this level of logging


## JavaScript
The JavaScript guidelines are based off of [idiomatic.js][idiomatic].

For lots of code examples that show the style we want, see the
[airbnb guide][airbnb].

The MSS Guidelines will be the same with the following additional rules applied.


### Test Facility
We will be using:

- Mocha / Chai for unit tests
- Selenium (WebdriverJS) / Mocha / Chai for functional tests
- PhantomJS / CasperJS for functional tests


### Idiomatic Style Manifesto
0. Whitespace
    - 4-space soft indents are required.  This means four spaces or four spaces
      representing a tab.

0. Beautiful Syntax
    - 2.A - 2.C should not have `inner-space`.  Refer to 2.D for a syntax
      without `inner-space`.  Here is an example.
      ```javascript
      function foo(bar, baz) {
          var qux = bar + baz;

          for (i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
              console.log(qux);
          }

          if (bar === baz) {
              qux = bar * baz;
          } else {
              qux = bar / baz;
          }

          return qux;
      }
      ```

    - Single quotes must be used.

    - Object literals should look like this.
      ```javascript
      var objectLiteral;

      objectLiteral = {
          foo: 'bar',
          baz: 'qux'
      };
      ```

    - Milliseconds should be assigned in multiples of 1000, and always use
      explicit order of operations.
      ```javascript
      var
          oneSecond = 1000 * 1,
          oneMinute = 1000 * 60,
          fiveMinutes = (1000 * 60) * 5;
      ```


## HTML
0. Write clean semantic HTML5 markup.
0. Use double quotes for attributes.
0. Use proper indention.
0. Selector Attributes
  Never use an ID as a styling hook.
  Prefix any JavaScript class hooks with `js-`. Example: `class="js-foo foo"`
0. Closing `<li>` elements.
  `<li>` elements should not be closed. [Further reading on this inline-block
  issue.][inline]


## CSS / Sass
0. The CSS / Sass guidelines are based off of [csswizardry/CSS-Guidelines][css].
0. We use [nomalize.css][normalize] as our style reset.


#### Our CSS / Sass overrides
0. Declarations.
  Declarations should be in aplhabetical order (**NOT** by relevance).


## Markdown
0. All lines that are not code blocks should wrap at or under 80 columns.
0. Should allow trailing whitespace, since that is a valid Markdown syntax.
0. Should have 2 blank lines above each H1 and H2 heading except for the
   heading at the top of the document.  This is optinal for other headings.
0. Should have 4 blank lines to separate the link reference at the bottom of
   the document.
0. Should use `0.` for ordered lists
0. Should use `-` for unordered lists
0. Secondary bullets must be indented four spaces to render correctly on
  Bitbucket.
0. Do not try to put code blocks as secondary bullets in a list.  They will not
  render correctly on both GitHub and BitBucket. More details on this to come
  in the future.
